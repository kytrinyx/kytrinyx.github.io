  <h3>The Scandalous Story of the Dreadful Code Written by the Best of Us</h3>

  <p class="video-text">
    There are overlooked corners of our codebases. Ignored, unloved. Unimportant. Or so we thought. What was once inconsequential has—somehow—grown into ghastly mess. This talk tells the story of one such mess, and the taming of it.

  <h3>Mind the Gap</h3>

  <p class="video-text">
    How do you learn Go? First do the tour. Then read the language spec. Then write a lot of code. This works for a lot of people, but for some the gap between the tour and the spec is a vast chasm. This talk explores ways we might bridge this gap, and make Go accessible to a broader audience.

  <h3>Cultivating Instinct</h3>

  <p class="video-text">
    This talk examines the topic of perceptual learning through the lens of theory and practice—research and anecdotes—and speculates how it can be deployed strategically to train new experts.

  <h3>The Bait and Switch of Open Source</h3>

  <p class="video-text">
    Open Source sells itself as being about technical problems--delightfully thorny technical problems, at that. However, successful projects are filled with people, which introduces a whole different set of problems.

  <h3>Succession: A Refactoring Story</h3>

  <p class="video-text">
    Refactoring sometimes devolves into an appalling mess. You&#39;re chasing a broken test suite, and every change just makes it worse. An even more insidious antipattern is the slow, perfectly controlled process culminating in dreadful design.

  <h3>Overkill</h3>

  <p class="video-text">
