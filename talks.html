      <h3>Mind the Gap</h3>

      <p class="video-text">
     How do you learn Go? First do the tour. Then read the language spec. Then write a lot of code.
This works for a lot of people, but for some the gap between the tour and the spec is a vast chasm.
</p>

<p class="video-text">
In his GopherCon 2015 keynote, Russ Cox said: Go needs everyone’s help, and everyone isn’t here.
</p>

<p class="video-text">
This talk draws on two years of iterative exploration as well as scientific theory about learning and empirical studies about teaching. It examines several ways of bridging this gap, aiming to make Go accessible to a broader audience.

      <h3>The Bait and Switch of Open Source</h3>

     <p class="video-text">
 Open Source sells itself as being about technical problems--delightfully thorny technical problems, at that. However, successful projects are filled with people, which introduces a whole different set of problems.
 </p>

      <p class="video-text">
This talk tells a story about the many ways in which things went badly wrong because I didn’t treat people problems as first-class citizens in exercism.io.d Sandi Metz and I are writing the book to prove it.

      <h3>Succession: A Refactoring Story</h3>

     <p class="video-text">
      Refactoring sometimes devolves into an appalling mess. You're chasing a broken test suite, and every change just makes it worse. An even more insidious anti-pattern is the slow, perfectly controlled process culminating in dreadful design.
      </p>

      <p class="video-text">
This talk presents an end-to-end refactoring that demonstrates simple strategies to avoid such misadventures.
