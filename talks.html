      <h3>The Bait and Switch of Open Source</h3>

     <p class="video-text">
 Open Source sells itself as being about technical problems--delightfully thorny technical problems, at that. However, successful projects are filled with people, which introduces a whole different set of problems.
 </p>

      <p class="video-text">
This talk tells a story about the many ways in which things went badly wrong because I didnâ€™t treat people problems as first-class citizens in exercism.io.d Sandi Metz and I are writing the book to prove it.

      <h3>Succession: A Refactoring Story</h3>

     <p class="video-text">
      Refactoring sometimes devolves into an appalling mess. You're chasing a broken test suite, and every change just makes it worse. An even more insidious anti-pattern is the slow, perfectly controlled process culminating in dreadful design.
      </p>

      <p class="video-text">
This talk presents an end-to-end refactoring that demonstrates simple strategies to avoid such misadventures.
